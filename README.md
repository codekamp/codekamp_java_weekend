/*
        * 1. To a variable of some class XYZ, we can assign objects of XYZ
        * class or it's subclasses
        *
        * 2. Allowed function calls are decided by type of variable,
        * not by type of Object stored
        *
        * 3. But during execution first is exectued over object, and not over variable.
        * i.e. function is searched inside Object's class and not Variable's class.

       /*
        * 1. An interface is just a list of function signatures
        *
        * 2. A class can claim to implement one or more interfaces. But if it
        * does so it has to implement all the functions listed in those interfaces
        * and their super interfaces.
        *
        * 3. We can make objects of classes but not of interfaces.
        *
        * 4. But we can make variables of both classes and interfaces.
        *
        * 5. In a variable of XYZ interface, we can store objects of a class
        * implementing (directly or inheritedly) that interface or it's sub interface.
